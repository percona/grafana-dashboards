## PMM Query Analytics Dashboard

The _Query Analytics_ dashboard enables database administrators and application
developers to analyze database queries over periods of time and find performance
problems.

Query Analytics helps you optimize database performance by making
sure that queries are executed as expected and within the shortest time
possible. In case of problems, you can see which queries may be the cause and
get detailed metrics for them.
