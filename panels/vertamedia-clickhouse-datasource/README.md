# Altinity Grafana datasource plugin for ClickHouse (grafana Grafana 4.6+ supported)

Altinity ClickHouse datasource plugin provides a support for [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech) as a backend database.

Initially plugin developed by Vertamedia, maintaned by Altinity since 2020.

## Quick start

### Grafana 7.x setup notes for plugin version before 2.2.0

When 2.0.x and 2.1.x vertamedia-clickhouse-grafana plugin versions released Grafana team didn't provide worked signing method for community plugins.
Current sign process describe on [grafana.com](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/sign-a-plugin/)

so, for properly setup 2.0.x and 2.1.x plugins you need change configuration option

```ini
[plugins]
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins=vertamedia-clickhouse-datasource
```

or setup environment variable

```bash
GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=vertamedia-clickhouse-datasource
```

You can install plugin from [grafana.com](https://grafana.com/plugins/vertamedia-clickhouse-datasource)

OR

Copy files to your [Grafana plugin directory](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/plugins/installation/#install-plugin-on-local-grafana).
Restart Grafana, check data sources list at Configuration -> Datasources -> New, choose ClickHouse option.

## Features

* Access to CH via HTTP / HTTPS
* Query setup
* Raw SQL editor
* Query formatting
* Macros support
* Additional functions
* Templates
* Table view
* SingleStat view
* Ad-hoc filters
* Annotations
* Alerts support
* Logs support

## Access to CH via HTTP / HTTPS

Page configuration is standard

![settings](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2902918/25473216/3ebd20fc-2b37-11e7-9743-fbbf2c5bdd3f.png)

There is a small feature - ClickHouse treats HTTP Basic Authentication credentials as a database user and will try to run queries using its name.

### [CHProxy](https://github.com/ContentSquare/chproxy) (optional)

Using of [CHProxy](https://github.com/ContentSquare/chproxy) will bring additional features:

* Easily setup `HTTPS` access to ClickHouse as shown [here](https://github.com/ContentSquare/chproxy#authorize-users-by-passwords-via-https)
to provide secure access.
* Limit concurrency and execution time for requests from `Grafana` as shown [here](https://github.com/ContentSquare/chproxy#spread-selects-from-reporting-apps-among-cluster-nodes)
to prevent `ClickHouse` overloading from `Grafana`.
* Protection against request bursts for dashboards with numerous graphs. `CHProxy` allows queueing requests and execute them sequentially.
To learn more - read about params `max_queue_size` and `max_queue_time` at [CHProxy](https://github.com/ContentSquare/chproxy) page.
* Response caching for the most frequent queries as shown [here](https://github.com/ContentSquare/chproxy#caching).

`Caching` will protect `ClickHouse` from excessive refreshes and will be optimal option for popular dashboards.
> Hint - if you need to cache requests like `last 24h` where timestamp changes constantly then try to use `Round` option at `Raw Editor`

## Query setup

Query setup interface:

![query editor image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2902918/32498037-2e9df438-c3d7-11e7-90de-73957c20cf6d.png)

First row `FROM` contains two options: database and table. Table values depends on a selected database.
Second row contains selectors for time filtering:

* Column:Date ([EventDate](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/date/))
* Column:DateTime ([DateTime](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/datetime/))
* Column:TimeStamp ([UInt32](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/int-uint/)).

> Plugin will try to detect date columns automatically
> `Column:DateTime` or `Column:TimeStamp` are required for time-based macros and functions because all analytics based on these values

Button `Go to Query` is just a toggler to Raw SQL Editor

## Raw SQL Editor

Raw Editor allows custom SQL queries to be written:

![raw editor image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2902918/32843338-337f2efc-ca28-11e7-9bde-ec65faa3cdc9.png)

Raw Editor allows typing queries, get info about functions and macros, format queries as Clickhouse do.
Under the Editor you can find a raw query (all macros and functions have already been replaced) which will be sent directly to ClickHouse.

## Macros support

Plugin supports the following marcos:

* $table - replaced with selected table name from Query Builder
* $dateCol - replaced with `Column:Date` value from Query Builder
* $dateTimeCol - replaced with `Column:DateTime` or `Column:TimeStamp` value from Query Builder
* $from - replaced with (timestamp with ms)/1000 value of UI selected "Time Range:From"
* $to - replaced with (timestamp with ms)/1000 value of UI selected "Time Range:To"
* $interval - replaced with selected "Group by a time interval" value (as a number of seconds)
* $timeFilter - replaced with currently selected "Time Range".
  Requires Column:Date and Column:DateTime or Column:TimeStamp to be selected.
* $timeFilterByColumn($column) - replaced with currently selected "Time Range" for a column passed as `$column` argument. Use it in queries or query variables as `...WHERE $timeFilterColumn($column)...` or `...WHERE $timeFilterColumn(created_at)...`.
* $timeSeries - replaced with special ClickHouse construction to convert results as time-series data. Use it as "SELECT $timeSeries...".
* $naturalTimeSeries - replaced with special ClickHouse construction to convert results as time-series with in a logical/natural breakdown. Use it as "SELECT $naturalTimeSeries...".
* $unescape - unescapes variable value by removing single quotes. Used for multiple-value string variables: "SELECT $unescape($column) FROM requests WHERE $unescape($column) = 5"
* $adhoc - replaced with a rendered ad-hoc filter expression, or "1" if no ad-hoc filters exist. Since ad-hoc applies automatically only to outer queries the macros can be used for filtering in inner queries.

A description of macros is available by typing their names in Raw Editor

## Functions

Functions are just templates of SQL queries, and you can check the final query at [Raw SQL Editor mode](https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-grafana/blob/master/README.md#raw-sql-editor).
If you need some additional complexity - just copy raw sql into Raw Editor and make according changes. Remember that macros are still available to use.

There are some limits in function use because of poor query analysis:

* Column:Date and Column:DateTime or Column:TimeStamp must be set in Query Builder
* Query must begin from function name
* Only one function can be used per query

Plugin supports the following functions:

### $rate(cols...) - converts query results as "change rate per interval"

Example usage:

```sql
$rate(countIf(Type = 200) AS good, countIf(Type != 200) AS bad) FROM requests
```

Query will be transformed into:

```sql
SELECT
    t,
    good / runningDifference(t / 1000) AS goodRate,
    bad / runningDifference(t / 1000) AS badRate
FROM
(
    SELECT
        (intDiv(toUInt32(EventTime), 60)) * 1000 AS t,
        countIf(Type = 200) AS good,
        countIf(Type != 200) AS bad
    FROM requests
    WHERE ((EventDate >= toDate(1482796747)) AND (EventDate <= toDate(1482853383))) AND ((EventTime >= toDateTime(1482796747)) AND (EventTime <= toDateTime(1482853383)))
    GROUP BY t
    ORDER BY t
)
```

---

### $columns(key, value) - query values as array of [key, value], where key will be used as label

Example usage:

```sql
$columns(OSName, count(*) c)
FROM requests
ANY INNER JOIN oses USING (OS)
```

Query will be transformed into:

```sql
SELECT
    t,
    groupArray((OSName, c)) AS groupArr
FROM
(
    SELECT
        (intDiv(toUInt32(EventTime), 60) * 60) * 1000 AS t,
        OSName,
        count(*) AS c
    FROM requests
    ANY INNER JOIN oses USING (OS)
    WHERE ((EventDate >= toDate(1482796627)) AND (EventDate <= toDate(1482853383))) AND ((EventTime >= toDateTime(1482796627)) AND (EventTime <= toDateTime(1482853383)))
    GROUP BY
        t,
        OSName
    ORDER BY
        t,
        OSName
)
GROUP BY t
ORDER BY t
```

This will help to build the next graph:

### $rateColumns(key, value) - is a combination of $columns and $rate

Example usage:

```sql
$rateColumns(OS, count(*) c) FROM requests
```

Query will be transformed into:

```sql
SELECT
    t,
    arrayMap(lambda(tuple(a), (a.1, a.2 / runningDifference(t / 1000))), groupArr)
FROM
(
    SELECT
        t,
        groupArray((OS, c)) AS groupArr
    FROM
    (
        SELECT
            (intDiv(toUInt32(EventTime), 60) * 60) * 1000 AS t,
            OS,
            count(*) AS c
        FROM requests
        WHERE ((EventDate >= toDate(1482796867)) AND (EventDate <= toDate(1482853383))) AND ((EventTime >= toDateTime(1482796867)) AND (EventTime <= toDateTime(1482853383)))
        GROUP BY
            t,
            OS
        ORDER BY
            t,
            OS
    )
    GROUP BY t
    ORDER BY t
)

```

### $perSecond(cols...) - converts query results as "change rate per interval" for Counter-like(growing only) metrics

Example usage:

```sql
$perSecond(Requests) FROM requests
```

Query will be transformed into:

```sql
SELECT
    t,
    if(runningDifference(max_0) < 0, nan, runningDifference(max_0) / runningDifference(t / 1000)) AS max_0_PerSecond
FROM
(
    SELECT
        (intDiv(toUInt32(EventTime), 60) * 60) * 1000 AS t,
        max(Requests) AS max_0
    FROM requests
    WHERE ((EventDate >= toDate(1535711819)) AND (EventDate <= toDate(1535714715)))
    AND ((EventTime >= toDateTime(1535711819)) AND (EventTime <= toDateTime(1535714715)))

## Templating

### Query Variable

If you add a template variable of the type `Query`, you can write a ClickHouse query that can
return things like measurement names, key names or key values that are shown as a dropdown select box.

For example, you can have a variable that contains all values for the `hostname` column in a table if you specify a query like this in the templating variable *Query* setting.

```sql
SELECT hostname FROM host
```

To use time range dependent macros like `timeFilterByColumn($column)` in your query the refresh mode of the template variable needs to be set to *On Time Range Change*.

```sql
SELECT event_name FROM event_log WHERE $timeFilterByColumn(time_column)
```

Another option is a query that can create a key/value variable. The query should return two columns that are named `__text` and `__value`. The `__text` column value should be unique (if it is not unique then the first value will use). The options in the dropdown will have a text and value that allows you to have a friendly name as text and an id as the value. An example query with `hostname` as the text and `id` as the value:

```sql
SELECT hostname AS __text, id AS __value FROM host
```

You can also create nested variables. For example if you had another variable named `region`. Then you could have the hosts variable only show hosts from the current selected region with a query like this (if `region` is a multi-value variable then use the `IN` comparison operator rather than `=` to match against multiple values):

```sql
SELECT hostname FROM host WHERE region IN ($region)
```

### Conditional Predicate

If you are using templating to feed your predicate, you will face performance degradation when everything will select as the predicate, and it's not necessary. It's also true for textbox when nothing is entered, you have to write specific sql code to handle that.

To resolve this issue a new macro $conditionalTest(SQL Predicate,$variable) can be used to remove some part of the query.
If the variable is type query with all selected or if the variable is a textbox with nothing enter, then the SQL Predicate is not include in the generated query.

To give an example:
with 2 variables
  $var query with include All option
  $text textbox
  $text_with_single_quote textbox with single quote

  The following query

  ```sql
   SELECT
     $timeSeries as t,
     count()
     FROM $table
     WHERE $timeFilter
      $conditionalTest(AND toLowerCase(column) in ($var),$var)
      $conditionalTest(AND toLowerCase(column2) like '%$text%',$text)
      $conditionalTest(AND toLowerCase(column3) ilike ${text_with_single_quote:sqlstring},$text_with_single_quote)
     GROUP BY t
     ORDER BY t
  ```

   if the `$var` is selected as "All" value, and the `$text` variable is empty, the query will be converted into:

  ```sql
    SELECT
      $timeSeries as t,
      count()
       FROM $table
       WHERE $timeFilter
     GROUP BY t
     ORDER BY t
  ```

  If the `$var` template variable have select some elements, and the `$text` template variable has at least one char, the query will be converted into:

  ```sql
  SELECT
      $timeSeries as t,
      count()
       FROM $table
       WHERE $timeFilter
     AND toLowerCase(column) in ($var)
     AND toLowerCase(column2) like '%$text%'
     GROUP BY t
     ORDER BY t
 ```

## Working with panels

### Pie Chart ([https://grafana.com/plugins/grafana-piechart-panel](https://grafana.com/plugins/grafana-piechart-panel))

Remember that pie chart plugin is not welcome for using in grafana - see [Grafana BLog - Friends don't let friends abuse pie charts](https://grafana.com/blog/2015/12/04/friends-dont-let-friends-abuse-pie-charts)

![top5things](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2902918/25392562/9fadb202-29e1-11e7-95ca-5b0d2921c592.png)

To create "Top 5" diagram we will need two queries: one for 'Top 5' rows and one for 'Other' row.

Top5:

```sql
SELECT
    1 AS t, /* fake timestamp value */
    UserName,
    sum(Requests) AS Reqs
FROM requests
GROUP BY t, UserName
ORDER BY Reqs DESC
LIMIT 5
```

Other:

```sql
SELECT
    1 AS t, /* fake timestamp value */
    UserName,
    sum(Requests) AS Reqs
FROM requests
GROUP BY t, UserName
ORDER BY Reqs
LIMIT 5,10000000000000 /* select some ridiculous number after first 5 */
```

### Table view ([https://grafana.com/plugins/table](https://grafana.com/plugins/table))

There are don't contain any tricks in displaying time-series data. To print summary data, omit time column, and format the result as "Table".

```sql
SELECT
    UserName,
    sum(Requests) as Reqs
FROM requests
GROUP BY
    UserName
ORDER BY
    Reqs
```

### Vertical histogram ([https://grafana.com/plugins/graph](https://grafana.com/plugins/graph))

![vertical histogram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2902918/25392561/9f3777e0-29e1-11e7-8b23-2ea9ae46a029.png)

To make the vertical histogram from graph panel we will need to edit some settings:

* Display -> Draw Modes -> Bars
* Axes -> X-Axis -> Mode -> Series

You can use next query:

```sql
$columns(
    Size,
    sum(Items) Items)
FROM some_table
```

// It is also possible to use query without macros

### Worldmap panel ([https://github.com/grafana/worldmap-panel](https://github.com/grafana/worldmap-panel))

![worldmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2902918/39430337-47513f4c-4c96-11e8-981d-04533538abec.png)

If you have a table with country/city codes:

```sql
SELECT
    1,
    Country AS c,
    sum(Requests) AS Reqs
FROM requests
GLOBAL ANY INNER JOIN
(
    SELECT Country, CountryCode
    FROM countries
) USING (CountryCode)
WHERE $timeFilter
GROUP BY
    c
ORDER BY Reqs DESC
```

If you are using [geohash](https://github.com/grafana/worldmap-panel#geohashes-as-the-data-source) set following options:

![Format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2902918/32726398-96793438-c881-11e7-84b8-26e82dbdb40c.png)

You can make following query with `Table` formatting:

![geohash-query](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2902918/32726399-96a01e86-c881-11e7-9368-61207bae72fd.png)

## Ad-hoc filters

If there is an Ad-hoc variable, plugin will fetch all columns of all tables of all databases (except system database) as tags.
So in dropdown menu will be options like `database.table.column`. If you specify the default database it will only fetch tables and columns from that database, and the dropdown menu will have an option like `table.column`.
If there are ENUM columns, the plugin will fetch their options and use them as tag values.
Also, plugin will fetch 300 unique values for fields with other types.

Plugin will apply Ad-hoc filters to all queries on the dashboard if their settings `$database` and `$table` are the same
as `database.table` specified in Ad-hoc control. If the ad-hoc filter doesn't specify a table, it will apply to all queries regardless of the table.
This is useful if the dashboard contains queries to multiple different tables.

> There are no option to apply OR operator for multiple Ad-hoc filters - see grafana/grafana#10918
> There are no option to use IN operator for Ad-hoc filters due to Grafana limitations

There may be cases when CH contains too many tables and columns so their fetching could take notably amount of time. So, if you need
to have multiple dashboards with different databases using of `default database` won't help. The best way to solve this will be to have parametrized
ad-hoc variable in dashboard settings. Currently, it's not supported by Grafana interface (see [issue](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/13109)).
As a temporary workaround, plugin will try to look for variable with name `adhoc_query_filter` and if it exists will use its value as query to fetch columns.
For this purpose we recommend creating some variable `constant` with the name `adhoc_query_filter` and set the value similar to the following one:

```sql
SELECT database, table, name, type FROM system.columns WHERE table='myTable' ORDER BY database, table
```

That should help to control data fetching by ad-hoc queries.

## Template variable values via Query

To use time range dependent macros like `$from` and `$to` in your query the refresh mode of the template variable needs to be set to On Time Range Change.

```sql
SELECT ClientID FROM events WHERE EventTime > toDateTime($from) AND EventTime < toDateTime($to)
```

## Annotations

Plugin support Annotations with regions. To enable this feature open Dashboard `settings` and add new annotation query with `clickhouse` datasource with properly field names.

![Annotation query example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105560/115864672-a35c3480-a450-11eb-88f4-1103a00c6563.png)

## Alerts support

To enable alerts open "alerts" tab in panel, and define alert expression as described on [grafana.com](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/)

Be careful with Template variables values, currently grafana doesn't support template variables in alert queries itself.
Also, grafana UI doesn't pass template variables values to a backend, after you change it on frontend UI.

So, the clickhouse grafana plugin can use template variables values, because we have "Generated SQL" which pass to backend "as is"
To ensure template variables values will properly pass to a backend part of the plugin.
Please choose the required template variables values for your alerts in UI dropdown,
ensure values properly rendered in "Generated SQL" (maybe need change SQL queries in query editor)
and save a whole dashboard to the Grafana server

WARNING: `Test alert` button doesn't save a current state of alert rules to a backend part of the plugin.

If the "Generated SQL" properly passed into backend part of plugin, you will see something like this:
![Graph panel with alerts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105560/115866047-95a7ae80-a452-11eb-9dd0-8e85b89e99ec.png)

You also can try to troubleshoot alerts in clickhouse grafana plugin when enable `level=debug` in `log` section `grafana.ini` or via `GF_LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable.

## Logs support

To render your ClickHouse data as Logs, please use special format in "Format as" dropdown in Query Editor called "Logs". This option helps Grafana recognizes data as logs and shows logs visualization automatically in Explore UI. On dashboards you can use [Logs panel](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/visualizations/logs-panel/) as well.

To return suitable for logs data - query should return at least one time field (assumed that it will be first field) and one text field from the ClickHouse.

Plugin is also transforming all text fields, except log line, into the labels using following rules:

* Log line will be taken either from dedicated `content` field or from first in order text field in result
* All other text fields will be treated as a labels

There are few dedicated fields that are recognized by Grafana:

* `level` (string) - set the level for each log line
* `id` (string) - by default, Grafana offers basic support for deduplicating log lines, that can be improved by adding this field to explicitly assign identifiers to each log line

All other fields returned from data source will be recognized by Grafana as [detected fields](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/logs-integration/#labels-and-detected-fields)

## Configure the Datasource with Provisioning

It’s now possible to configure datasources using config files with Grafana’s provisioning system.
You can read more about how it works and all the settings you can set for datasources on the [provisioning docs page](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#datasources).

Here are some provisioning example:

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

datasources:
 - name: Clickhouse
   type: vertamedia-clickhouse-datasource
   access: proxy
   url: http://localhost:8123
   # <bool> enable/disable basic auth
   basicAuth: false
   # <string> basic auth username
   basicAuthUser: "default"
   # <bool> enable/disable with credentials headers
   withCredentials: false
   # <bool> mark as default datasource. Max one per org
   isDefault: false
   # <map> fields that will be converted to json and stored in json_data
   jsonData:
     # <bool> enable/disable sending 'add_http_cors_header=1' parameter
     addCorsHeader: false
     # <bool> enable/disable using POST method for sending queries
     usePOST: false
     # <string> default database name
     defaultDatabase: ""
     # <bool> enable/disable tls authorization
     tlsAuth: false
     # <bool> enable/disable tls authorization with custom ca
     tlsAuthWithCACert: false
     # <bool> enable/disable authorization with X-ClickHouse-* headers
     useYandexCloudAuthorization: true
     # <string> X-ClickHouse-User header value for authorization
     xHeaderKey: ""
     # <string> X-ClickHouse-Key header value for authorization
     xHeaderUser: ""
   secureJsonData:
       # <string> basic auth password
       basicAuthPassword: ""
       # <string> custom certificate authority for TLS https connection, base64 encoded 
       tlsCACert: ""
       # <string> custom client certificate for TLS https connection, base64 encoded 
       tlsClientCert: ""
       # <string> custom client secret key for TLS https connection, base64 encoded 
       tlsClientKey: ""
```

Some settings and security params are the same for all datasources. You can find them [here](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#example-datasource-config-file).

## FAQ

> Why time series last point is not the real last point?

Plugin extrapolates last datapoint if time range is `last N` to avoid displaying of constantly decreasing graphs
when timestamp in a table is rounded to minute or bigger.
If it so then in 99% cases last datapoint will be much less than previous one, because last minute is not finished yet.
That's why plugin checks prev datapoints and tries to predict last datapoint value just as it was already written into db.
This behavior could be turned off via "Extrapolation" checkbox in query editor.

> Which table schema used in SQL query examples?

All examples in this plugin use following table schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS countries(
    Country LowCardinality(String),
    CountryCode LowCardinality(String)
) ENGINE MergeTree()
ORDER BY (CountryCode, Country);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS oses (
    OSName LowCardinality(String),
    OS LowCardinality(String)
) ENGINE MergeTree()
ORDER BY (OS);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS requests(
    EventTime DateTime,
    EventDate Date,
    Protocol LowCardinality(String),
    UserName LowCardinality(String),
    OS LowCardinality(String),
    CountryCode LowCardinality(String),
    Type UInt8,
    Requests UInt32
) ENGINE=MergeTree()
ORDER BY (EventDate, EventTime, Type, OS, Protocol, UserName)
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(EventDate);
```

> What about alerts support?

Alerts feature requires changes in `Grafana`'s backend, which can be extended only for Grafana 6.5+. `Grafana`'s maintainers are working on this feature.
Current alerts support for `clickhouse-grafana` datasource plugin in beta.

For clickhouse grafana plugin 2.2.3+ support only for amd64 architecture for Linux, macOS, Windows and arm64 Linux, macOS (m1).
Only amd64 prior 2.2.3 version.
